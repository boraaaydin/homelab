- Add healthcheck in every docker compose with curl
- After updating healthcheck, first test it from inside container with proper command
- every app will have .env file
- each app should be under network name shared_network  
- add container_name label with proper label.
- add 'pids_limit: 100' labels on every docker compose yml. 
- HOST_PORT should be added to every docker compose yml file.
- Port exposure should be optional and managed through separate docker-compose.ports.yml file
- add traefik labels on every docker compose yml file.

      - 'traefik.http.routers.freshrss-secure.entrypoints=websecure'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.freshrss-secure.tls=true'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.freshrss-secure.tls.certresolver=cloudflare'
