## Update the image tag if you want to upgrade your Mattermost version. You may also upgrade to the latest one. The example is based on the latest Mattermost ESR version.
MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=9.11.6

## Make Mattermost container readonly. This interferes with the regeneration of root.html inside the container. Only use
## it if you know what you're doing.
## See https://github.com/mattermost/docker/issues/18

## the system console as well and settings set with env variables will be greyed out.

## Below one can find necessary settings to spin up the Mattermost container
